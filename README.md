A console-playable version of the game connect four, made as part of The Odin Project's Ruby programming course - [Project: Testing your ruby code](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/testing-your-ruby-code)

The main function of this project was focussed on using TDD to develop and write the code for the game, more than about making the game itself.

**Features to add**
* Allow player to add name?
* Change player's icons?
* Stylise display of game cage?
* Promt that move cannot be made
* Allow for exit/quit command
